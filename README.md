AI Risk Monitoring Agent
Overview
The AI Risk Monitoring Agent is a real-time solution that scans articles and assesses their potential risk to a company. By evaluating articles based on predefined risk factors related to company interests, it can determine whether an article is high risk, medium risk, or low risk. The agent sends notifications via Discord webhooks to a user, alerting them of high-risk articles and providing critical information for swift decision-making.

Features
Real-Time Article Monitoring: The agent continuously scans articles from various sources and provides instant risk assessments.

AI-Powered Risk Classification: Using AI, the agent classifies articles into high, medium, or low risk categories based on predefined criteria, including:

Potential negative impact on company reputation
Public/customer sentiment or media attention
Likelihood of escalation
Urgency of the situation
Critical Alerts via Discord: When a high-risk article is identified, the agent sends a detailed notification via Discord, summarizing the article and providing reasoning for its classification.

Customizable Risk Criteria: Adjust the criteria that define what constitutes high, medium, or low risk to match your specific business needs.
